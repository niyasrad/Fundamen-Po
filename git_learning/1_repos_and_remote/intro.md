## Repositories and Remotes

Repositories are maintained remotely- while you also collaborate with others.

### Maintaining Remote Repositories

Repositories are managed by adding such remote repositories, removing them when they're not valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not. Managing them is an important skill.

### Cloning a repository

You can clone a repository by using the following command

-> ```git clone <repository_link_here>```
